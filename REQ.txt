Hello Babar,

You are required to develop a complete blog API.

Requirements:
The users can be of type Author or Reader.
The users can SignIn Signout of the API.
The signed in user can create a post by providing (title, text content, images, tags).
The signed in user can retrieve a list of posts with only required attributes with pagination. eg (Retrieve only title and tags, retrieve title and text).
The Author can update and delete his posts.
You are required to develop a framework that does the job, clearly defines authentication, authorization and caching for user sessions.

Choice of Tools:
You can use any mechanism for auth, caching and database of your choice. The only limitation here is that your framework uses express js as middleware.

Once the test is completed, please email the solution back to me in reply to this email. You have til Sunday midnight (12th April, 11:59pm).

Best of luck!
